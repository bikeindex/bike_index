        methods and processes to chasing bike thieves.

      terms_of_service_for_vendors: Terms of Service for Vendors
      tos_agreement: >-
        The Terms and Conditions described here constitute a legal "Agreement" between
        the sole proprietor or business organization listed as the "Vendor" on the
        Service registration page (sometimes referred to as "you," "your", "merchant"),
        and Bike Index, NFP. ("Bike Index").
      vendor_registration: Vendor Registration
      vendor_registration_p1: >-
        The Bike Index Vendor Service is only made available under this Agreement
        to persons that operate a business selling goods or services, or operate cycling
        related organizations. To use Bike Index to register bikes, you will first
        have to register for a "Vendor Account." When you register for a Bike Index
        Vendor Account, we will collect basic information including your name, company
        name, location, email address, and phone number. If you have not already done
        so, you will also be required to provide an email address and password for
        your Bike Index account.
      vendor_registration_p2: >-
        When you register as a Vendor, you must also provide information about an
        owner or principal of the business or organization and you must be authorized
        to act on behalf of the business and have the authority to bind the business
        to this Agreement. To sign up a business to use the Service, you must agree
        to this Agreement on behalf of the business. If you have so agreed, the term
        "you" will mean you, the natural person, as well as the business organization
        that you represent.
      verification: Verification
      verification_p1: >-
        We may ask for information to help verify your identity including a driver’s
        license or other government issued identification, or a business license.
        We may request your permission to do a physical inspection at your place of
        business and to examine bicycles that pertain to your compliance with this
        Agreement. Your failure to comply with any of these requests within five (5)
        days may result in deactivation or termination of your Bike Index account.
        You authorize us to retrieve additional information about you from third parties
        and other identification services.
      verification_p2: >-
        After we have collected and verified all your information, Bike Index will
        review your Account and determine if you are eligible to use the Service.
        Bike Index will notify you once your account has been either approved or deemed
        ineligible for use of the Service.
      verification_p3: >-
        By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you are providing us with authorization
        to retrieve information about you by using third parties, including bike industry
        wholesalers, distributors, and other information providers. You acknowledge
        that such information retrieved may include your name, address history, business
        history, and other data about you. Bike Index may periodically update this
        information to determine whether you continue to meet our eligibility requirements.
      verification_p4: >-
        You agree that Bike Index is permitted to contact and share information about
        you and your application (including whether you are approved or declined),
        as well as your use of Bike Index with our friends.
      we_can_deactivate_html: |
        We can deactivate your ability to register new bikes or terminate this
        "Agreement" at any time (especially if you do something bad). You can also
        terminate anytime. Termination is effective immediately. Termination does not
        alter your previously registered bikes. This section also includes all the extra
        legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment).

      welcome_to_bike_index_html: |
        <strong>Welcome to Bike Index</strong>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. We developed a
        publicly-accessible bike registration service (the "Service") that gives
        organizations registered on Bike Index ("Vendors", "you") the ability to quickly
        and easily register bikes for their "Customers" - patrons of their services -
        using Vendor "Accounts." We believe that such a service deters
        bike theft and helps Customers recover stolen bikes.

      what_about_my_privacy: What about my privacy?
      your_personal_information_is_never_viewed: Your personal information is never viewed, shared or sold without your permission.
      bikes_are_public_and_searchable: Bikes are public and searchable, but no information about the owner is visible. You can choose to share information (such as your twitter or personal website) but this is turned off by default.

      to_learn_more_html: To learn more check out %{article_link} about privacy.
      why_public: Why are serial numbers and non-stolen bikes public?
      serial_numbers_public: We make serial numbers public because it's the best way to recover stolen bikes and deter theft.
      the_faster_and_easier_it_is: The faster and easier it is to access serials, the more stolen bikes we recover. Restricting access to serial numbers only helps thieves.
      this_isnt_optimistic_speculation: 'This isn''t optimistic speculation: we''ve proved this and continue to do so with every stolen bike we recover.'
      weve_recovered_bikes: We've recovered bikes before they could even be marked stolen because they could be found on the Index.
      security_by_obscurity_link: security by obscurity
      other_registries_html: Other registries generally hide serials because of their technical limitations. They keep information away from those most likely to use it for good, even though %{wikipedia_link} doesn't work.
      while_serial_numbers: While serial numbers and bike information is public, there is nothing to connect users to the bikes they own. We never make user information available unless the user explicitly chooses to do so.
      we_care_about_your_privacy: We care about your privacy more than anyone â€” you can hide your registration so nobody but you can see it. We just don't think it's a good idea.

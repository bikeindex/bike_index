      title: Serial numbers
      intro: All bikes
      intro2: all have unique serial numbers.

      words:
        word1: maybe

      texts:
        text1: "Most bicycles have their serial number engraved beneath their bottom bracket, 
                but sometimes serial numbers are found in other places. Here are some examples of where 
                and what to look for:"
        text2: The bottom bracket (where serial numbers are typically located) is circled.
        text3: A serial number on the underside of a bottom bracket.
        text4: "Another serial number beneath the bottom bracket, aligned parallel to the frame."
        text5: Some Schwinn bicycles have the unique identifying number on their head tube (which 
               is on the front of the bike).
        text6: A serial number located on a rear drop out. Some BMX bikes and a few Schwinn 
               bicycles place the serial on the rear dropout.  On older Schwinns there are 
               numbers stamped on both the drive side and non-drive side rear dropouts; the 
               one on the non-drive side dropout is the serial number.
        text7: Some bikes have multiple serial numbers.
        text8: When adding a bike to the Index, it's best to enter all the groups of numbers and 
               letters separated by spaces.
        text9: Hopefully you can find the serial number on the bicycle you're looking at,
        text10: if you're having trouble.
        text11: Okay, fine, so 
        text12: there are a few bikes without serial numbers, but this is rare and typical only 
                on hand made bikes or really old bicycles.
        text13: In this picture
        text14: is a manufacturer number and not a serial number. However, to make bikes as easy as 
                possible to find, we'd love it if you entered all numbers you encounter.

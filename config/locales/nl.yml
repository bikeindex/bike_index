        TRME <strong>Bryan Hance</strong> created StolenBicycleRegistry.com in 2004
        because 5 of his bikes were stolen in 9 years&mdash;and realized
        recovering bikes was really fun. He lives in Portland and recovers lots
        of bikes.

      jan_pecnik_bio_html: |
        TRME <strong>Jan Pecnik</strong> fell in love with bikes while studying his masters in the

        years of solo riding, he now helps Bike Index expand across Europe and
        beyond.
      lily_williams_bio_html: |
        TRME <strong>Lily Williams</strong> has a master's degree from Medill School

        Index.

        TRME Merging the two services Seth and Bryan created the universal bike registration
        service they both dreamed of — a database used and searched by individuals,
        bike shops, police departments and other apps. A bike registry that gives
        everyone the ability to register and recover bicycles.
      mike_oleon_bio_html: |
        TRME <strong>Mike Oleon</strong> does the graphic design and illustration for the Index. If

      seth_built: >-
        TRME Seth built Bike Index when he was a bike mechanic because he wanted to
        be able to register bikes for his customers. Bryan developed and ran a community
        driven bicycle recovery service (StolenBikeRegistry.com) that recovered bikes
        from the first week it was created in 2004.

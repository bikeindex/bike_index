    Save information about your bike lock!
  %p
    Lock keys often have serial numbers, so you can order replacements if you lose the keys.
  %p
    If you want, you can
    %strong
      save the serial numbers of your keys
    on the Bike Index&mdash;so you won't be out of luck if you lose them.
  %p
    You can also
    %strong
      record your lock combinations.
  %p
    %em
      Any lock information you enter on the Bike Index is private and visible only to you.

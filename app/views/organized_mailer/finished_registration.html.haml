      Protect your bike by following these locking guidelines.

      %li
        %strong
          Use a U-Lock.
        Cable locks should never be used as a primary means of locking a bike in a city.
      %li
        Secure both wheels - either with two U-locks, or one U-lock and one heavy duty cable.
      %li
        Before locking, check that what you are locking to can't be easily removed.

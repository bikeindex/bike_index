            Use a U-Lock.
          Cable locks should never be used as a primary means of locking a bike in a city.
        %li
          Secure both wheels - either with two U-locks, or one U-lock and one heavy duty cable.
        %li
          Before locking, check that what you are locking to can't be easily removed.

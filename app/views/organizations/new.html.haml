      How it works:

      %li
        %span.green-bullet
        %p
          Fill in basic information about a bike and the customer's email.
      %li

          We send them an email with the information about their bike.
      
    %p
      That's it!

      The customer doesn't need to do anything else either. If they want to, they can sign in and upload photos or add details to their bike &mdash; but even if they don't, they have a permanent record of their bike.
    %p
      If their bike is ever stolen they have all the information they need to file a police report, make an insurance claim and, most importantly, they can mark their bike stolen on the Bike Index &mdash; where it has the best chance of being found.

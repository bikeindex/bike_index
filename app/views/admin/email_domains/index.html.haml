            In 2024 we started getting spam signups - of 10s of thousands of users a week, from junk domains.
          %p
            I'm unclear on what the exploit is, but this costs us money (to send the emails) and slows down all operations involving users (realistically, this is every page load for a signed in user). So I added this functionality to silently block them ðŸ¤· (and every night a job runs to delete any that exist).
          %p
            Emails that end in these domains are deleted right after sign up and aren't sent a confirmation (but they still are shown the page that says they need to confirm their email, just like a normal user).

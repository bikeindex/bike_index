  Welcome to your Ambassador homepage

%p
  This page contains the resources you need to become a great bike advocate in
  your community. Here you will find documents, tips, articles, and
  recommendations for helping cyclists where you live and connecting with
  Ambassadors around the world doing the same in their communities.

%p
  Being a Bike Index Ambassador means helping people, where you live, to
  register and protect their bikes in case of theft. Share Bike Index with bike
  shops, advocacy groups, universities, and law enforcement to aid larger
  numbers and more kinds of cyclists in your area.

%p
  On this page, we've listed effective activities for registering cyclists in
  Bike Index. You can track progress and get ideas from other Ambassadors in
  your area about successful strategies. If you have any questions, post them in
  our Slack channel or email
  #{link_to "lily@bikeindex.org", "mailto:lily@bikeindex.org"}.

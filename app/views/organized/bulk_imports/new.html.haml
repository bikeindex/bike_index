    Register bikes from a CSV
  %p
    %strong
      Your CSV <em>must</em> have our required headers.
    The required headers are <code>manufacturer</code>, <code>model</code> <code>color</code> <code>email</code> and <code>serial</code>.

  %p
    Look at #{link_to "our example CSV here", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bikeindex/bike_index/master/public/import_only_required.csv"}.

  %h5 Notes on successfully importing:
  %ul
    %li
      For best results, put quotes around all the cells.
    %li
      Your headers must match our headers <em>exactly</em> - for example if you have "serial #" as a header, the import will not work.
    %li
      Doing an import for the first time? Try importing a sample of your CSV with just 1 or 2 rows, and replace the email with your own email - so if the bikes don't import correctly, you can make adjustments and delete the bikes, without having to delete a large number of bikes.

  Optional additions:
%ul
  %li
    We support a few additional, optional columns. You do not have to include them unless you want to
  %li
    You can see an #{link_to "example CSV here", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bikeindex/bike_index/master/public/import_all_optional_fields.csv"} with all the columns we support
  %li
    If only some of your bikes have values in optional columns, leave the cell blank for the ones that don't have it (rather than putting <em>unknown</em> or <em>n/a</em>). For example, as shown in the above csv, the second bike doesn't have a year.

        %h3 Why Bike Index?
        %p
          We’ve designed a platform to solve a fundamental barrier in safeguarding bicycles: the lack of a universal bike registry. With our consolidated university registration sites, it's easier for police and transportation departments to search and recover campus bicycles. 
        %p
          Your students can register their bikes, verify ownership, and alert the community to missing bikes from anywhere. All they need is any smartphone or laptop. You have access to the data behind it all to understand how best to protect bikes on your campus.

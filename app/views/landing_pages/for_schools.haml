        %h3 Why Choose Bike Index?
        %p
          Students have limited protections against bike theft, that’s why we’ve designed a platform to solve a fundamental barrier in safeguarding their bikes: the lack of a universal bike registry.
        %p
          With our web-based tools, your students can register their bikes, verify ownership, and alert the community to missing bikes from anywhere, with just a Smartphone or laptop.

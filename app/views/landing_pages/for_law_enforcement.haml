        %h3 How it works
        %p
          Bike Index users provide serial numbers, proof of ownership and identifying information about their bikes. When a bike is reported lost or stolen, our partners can search Bike Index to identify, locate, and track it from any computer or smartphone. Our extensive archive has helped officers recover bikes involved in criminal situations, from simple theft to chop shops, drug houses - even fencing rings and online black markets.

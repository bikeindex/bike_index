        %h3 How it works
        %p
          Bike Index users provide serial numbers, proof of ownership, photographs, component information and detailed descriptions of their bikes. When a bike is reported lost or stolen, our partners can search Bike Index to identify, locate, and track it from any computer or Smartphone. Our extensive archive has helped officers recover bikes involved in criminal situations ranging from simple theft to chop shops, drug houses, fencing rings, and online black markets.

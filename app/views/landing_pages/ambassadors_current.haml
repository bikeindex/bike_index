          Bike Index allows us to verify details about the bike, theft details, police file number and contact info for the owner. We can also share the registry directly to Law Enforcement to expedite the recovery process.

          If a person loses their bike there is such a feeling of loss but when its recovered there is such a feeling of renewal and restoration. That is the reason I promote Bike Index

          Bike Index isn't the only internet bike registry, but it's the only one that works and I firmly believe it's a direct result of how it was designed.

          After a couple of recoveries, I got hooked. It was so nice to be able to return some of these bikes to people who really love them.

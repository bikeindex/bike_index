        %h3 Register bikes for your customers
        
        %p
          We offer an easy way for you to register your customer's bikes - new or old. All you need at the point of sale is the bike's serial number, manufacturer, color and customer's email. And with their permission, we'll send them an email with all the pertinent information and their bicycle will be protected, forever, for free.

        %h3 Register bikes for your customers
        %p
          We offer an easy way for you to register your customer's bikes. You can simply put in three basic pieces of information at point of sale - serial number, manufacturer, color and the customer's email, and they will receive an email with all the pertinent information and their bicycle will be protected, forever, for free.

        %h3 Use Lightspeed Retail?
        %p
          We have an official Lightspeed add-on to provide entirely automated registration. If you store your serial numbers in the serial number field in Lightspeed, we can register every bike you sell. All you'll have to do is make sure you take the customer's email.

        %p
          Gone are the days where you had to register your bike in your neighborhood, county, city, state and country. Bike Index provides one registry, giving all registrants around the U.S. access to our network of over 120,000 cyclists.  Our goal is to provide free and easy access to our registry for anyone and everyone who rides a bicycle, in any capacity.  

        %p
          We want to recover bikes that are stolen. And so do you. We need your help spreading the Bike Index word. In return, we can offer you the most widely used bike registration system in the country.

        %h3#ambassadors_why Why Work With Bike Index?
        %p
          Bike Index is a nonprofit with a big mission: register every bicycle out there, and recover every bike that gets stolen. That’s why we need your help. We’re a national registry but you know your cycling communities best.
        %p
          Anyone can help Bike Index. We are always in need of donations, connections to local bike shops and other organizations, and shares on social media. But maybe you know of a great shop or a budding advocacy group in your town that would love to register bikes for their users and constituents. Or maybe your local police department is looking to upgrade their registry. (Or maybe they don’t even have one yet).

        %p.mb-4
          You bring the ideas, make the connections, and we’ll make sure you have the resources to get stuff done.

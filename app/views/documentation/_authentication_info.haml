  ## Authentication notes
  Here are some notes on authentication with Bike Index. It's messy but maybe it will while we're in the process of incorporating this into the documentation.

  There are two supported ways of authenticating with Bike Index through OAuth2:

  1. Authorization flow (also called Explicit grant flow)

  2. Client-side flow (also called Implicit grant flow or Bearer flow)

  The Authorization flow enables long lived access through refresh tokens (instead of logging out the user every hour), is more secure, and is generally what you should be using. Learn more about [Authorization flow in OAuth2](http://labs.hybris.com/2012/06/01/oauth2-authorization-code-flow/).

  The Client-side flow is good for client-side javascript apps. Here's an article on [Client-side flow in OAuth2](http://labs.hybris.com/2012/06/05/oauth2-the-implicit-flow-aka-as-the-client-side-flow/).

  To review the applications you've authorized, go to [/oauth/authorized_applications](#{ENV['BASE_URL']}/oauth/authorized_applications)

  ### Authentication params

  By default doorkeeper authenticates clients using HTTP Basic authentication scheme. If the basic auth is not found in the authorization header, then it falls back to post parameters (client_id and client_secret).

  ### OAuth refresh tokens

  Since you have to send an access token with every request and they give access to someone's how you authenticate, it's important that they expire after 1 hour - so if someone compromises an access token, they don't have unlimited access to an account.

  When you get an access token you also receive a refresh token. When your access token expires, you can get a new one by making a POST request with your app id and the refresh token:

      POST #{ENV['BASE_URL']}/oauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=<app_id>&refresh_token=<refresh_token>

  in ruby, using the OAuth2 library: 

      client = OAuth2::Client.new('app_id', 'app_secret', site: "#{ENV['BASE_URL']}")
      puts client.auth_code.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob')
      # Vist the URL that is printed out and authenticate.
      # You will be sent to a page that shows you the access code, (because the redirect_uri is the one used for testing).
      
      token = client.auth_code.get_token(code, :redirect_uri => 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob')
      # Where "code" is the code from the page after authentication
      # Bike Index tokens expire in 1 hour - (but that is subject to change without notice)

      token.expired?
      # => false

      # If your token has expired, you will get this:
      token.expired?
      # => true

      # And you can refresh your token with 
      new_token = token.refresh!

  
  You will get a refresh token back when you create a token. As long as you have that token, you can create a new token when your existing token has expired.

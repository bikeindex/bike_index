      At Bike Index we believe that bicycle registration is one of the simplest and most effective ways to fight bicycle theft. By offering complete integration with Lightspeed Retail, we've made registration a quick, painless, and automated process for you and your customers.

        All you have to do is go to #{ link_to 'bikeindex.org/lightspeed_interface', lightspeed_interface_path }, where you'll be asked to authorize Bike Index to access your Lightspeed Account.

        The first step is to create an account for yourself and your shop - you can do that <a href="#add_organization" class="scroll-to-ref">at the bottom of this page</a>

        Once you have a Bike Index account set up for your shop, there will be a link on this page to take you to the integration.

      Once your Lightspeed Retail account is connected to your Bike Index account with automatic registration turned on, a listing on Bike Index will be automatically created for every bicycle you sell. All you need to do is add the customer's email address and the bicycle's serial number during a normal Lightspeed Retail checkout.

      The bicycle's owner will receive an email with all the information he or she needs to log in and maintain the account as well as a PDF copy of the registration information.

        If a customer doesn't want a bike to be added to Bike Index, simply write "DO NOT REGISTER" in the notes for the sale and the bicycle will not be registered.

    I started Bike Index because I wanted to register bikes for my customers at the shop where I worked &mdash; with this integration, we finally give shops a way to register bikes that doesn't interfere with selling them.

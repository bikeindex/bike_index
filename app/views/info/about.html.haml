  About Bike Index

  %p
    Cofounded by Seth Herr and Bryan Hance in 2013, Bike Index is a #{link_to '501(c)(3) nonprofit', 'https://bikeindex.org/news/bike-index--now-a-nonprofit'}.
  %p
    It is the most widely used and successful bicycle registration service in the world with over #{number_with_precision(Bike.count.round(-3), precision: 0, delimiter: ',')} cataloged bikes, #{number_with_precision(Organization.count.round(-1), precision: 0, delimiter: ',')} community partners and tens of thousands of daily searches.

%p
  Seth built Bike Index when he was a bike mechanic because he wanted to be able to register bikes for his customers. Bryan developed and ran a community driven bicycle recovery service (StolenBikeRegistry.com) that recovered bikes from the first week it was created in 2004.

%p
  Merging the two services Seth and Bryan created the universal bike registration service they both dreamed of&mdash;a database used and searched by individuals, bike shops, police departments and other apps. A bike registry that gives everyone the ability to register and recover bicycles.

%p
  Simple. Efficient. Effective.

    Bike registration that works.

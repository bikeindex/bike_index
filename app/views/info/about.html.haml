  About the Bike Index
%p
  Bryan started StolenBicycleRegistry.com in 2004 because he was tired of having bikes stolen. Seth started the Bike Index because he was a bike mechanic and wished there was an easy way to register bikes for his customers. We merged Bike Index and SBR in July of 2014 because it made perfect sense&mdash;Seth makes sure registration is effortless, and Bryan recovers stolen bikes.

  We're a small organization with no full time staff and we aren't funded, besides what we raised through #{link_to "Kickstarter", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1073266317/the-bike-index-lets-stop-bike-theft-together"}. But we work to make it better every day.
%p
  Despite our size, we are the best bike registry on the planet:

      <strong>We make it easy to register</strong>. We've made registration entirely automatic for #{link_to "some manufacturers", "https://bikeindex.org/news/heritage-bicycles-are-now-automatically-registered"} and for #{link_to "bike shops", "https://bikeindex.org/news/lightspeed-retail--bikeindex--win"}. We offer an easy way for any bike shop or advocacy organization to register bikes for their constituents.

        We recover stolen bikes
      every single week. During the summer we average more than one recovery a day. We generally #{link_to "tweet", "https://twitter.com/BikeIndex"} about them.

        We're the best place to list your stolen bike
      if you want to get it back. The Index is easy to search, so people (including the police even though they may not have an official integration) find bikes and return them. There are lots of bike registries (<a href="http://www.bikeshepherd.org/" title="BikeShepherd">a</a>, <a href="http://project529.com/" title="Project529">b</a>, <a href="http://nationalbikeregistry.com/" title="NBR">c</a>, <a href="http://safebikes.org/" title="SfSafe">d</a>, <a href="http://bikeregistry.com/" title="BikeRegistry.com">e</a>) &mdash; but none of them are easy to search, so not many stolen bikes are recovered. We know we aren't the only registry and we support registering in other places too - e.g. if you're in Chicago, cross list on #{link_to "chicago.stolenbike", "http://chicago.stolenbike.org/"}, it's well run and widely used in the bike community.

        We're not going to disappear. 
      Bryan ran StolenBikeRegistry.com for 10 years without getting paid. Operating the Bike Index costs just a few hundred dollars a month. We're really excited about making enough money from advertising that a few of us can work on this all the time though, so if you have something you'd like a bunch of people searching for bikes to see, contact  #{link_to "ads@bikeindex.org", "mailto:ads@bikeindex.org"}. We also #{link_to "accept donations", support_the_index_url} :).

        We're not going to rip you off.
      We won't sell your personal information, start charging hidden fees or send you unsolicited email. Selling stolen bikes shouldn't be easy, bike registration should be and we're going to keep working on this to make sure that happens.

      learned to program so that he could build the Bike Index, because he was a bike mechanic and was frustrated that something like it didn't exist.

      created StolenBicycleRegistry.com in 2005 because 5 of his bikes were stolen in 9 years. The first week it was live he recovered a bike - and realized recovering bikes was really fun. He lives in Portland and recovers lots of bikes.

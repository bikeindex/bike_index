            **Access token user** _must_ be a member of the organization from the `organization_slug`.

            It matches on `serial`, `owner_email` and `manufacturer`. No matches are returned if the serial is 'made_without_serial' or 'unknown'.

            This is the matching that happens when adding bikes, to prevent duplicate registrations. By default, adding a bike will update the existing bike if there is a match _which can be edited_ - and will create a new bike if the existing match can't be edited (however, if you include `no_duplicate` when adding a bike, it won't add a duplicate bike in that situation).

            The only difference between this and the behavior of add a bike, is that `manufacturer` is optional here.

            Returns JSON with keys:

            - `registered`: If a match was found. (`true` or `false`)
            - `can_edit`: If a match was found and it can be edited by the current token, e.g. was registered by the organization. (`true` or `false`)
            - `authorized_bike_id`: If `can_edit` is true, this returns the bike's ID (`Integer` or `null`)
            - `claimed`: If a match was found and the user has claimed the bike. (`true` or `false`)
            - `state`: The state of the bike that was found (_see below for possible values_)

            <br>

            `state` is one of the following string values:

            - `with_user`: Registered and the `owner_email` is the current owner of the bike
            - `stolen`: Stolen 🙁
            - `recovered`: It was stolen, but has been recovered within the past year (after a year, the state returns to `with_user`)
            - `impounded`: Impounded
            - `transferred`: Registered, but user transfered to someone else on Bike Index
            - `removed`: It was registered, but has been deleted from Bike Index
            - `no_matching_bike`: bike not found

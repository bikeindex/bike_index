            Current user is the owner of the `access_token` you use in the request. Depending on your scopes you will get different things back.
            You will always get the user's `id`
            For an array of the user's bike ids, you need `read_bikes` access
            For a hash of information about the user (including their email address), you need `read_user` access
            For an array of the organizations and/or shops they're a part of, `read_organization_membership` access

          notes: <<-NOTE
            This returns the current user's bikes, so long as the access_token has the `read_bikes` scope.
            This uses the bike list bike objects, which only contains the most important information.
            To get all possible information about a bike use `/bikes/{id}`

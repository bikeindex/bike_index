          notes: <<-NOTE
            If you want to search for bikes stolen near a specific location, you need to use this endpoint.
            Keep in mind that it only returns stolen bikes - so if you do a serial search, and nothing turns up that doesn't mean that the bike isn't registered.
            **Notes on location searching**: 
            - `proximity` accepts an ip address (IPv6 is supported), an address, zipcode, city, or latitude,longitude. e.g. `70.210.133.87`, `210 NW 11th Ave, Portland, OR`, `60647`, `Chicago, IL`, or `45.521728,-122.67326`
            - `proximity_square` sets the length of the sides of the square to find matches inside of. The square is centered on the location specified by `proximity`. It defaults to 100.
          NOTE
        }

          notes: <<-NOTE
            Include all the options you would pass in in your search. This will respond with a hash of the number of bikes matching your search for each type:

            ```javascript
            {
              "proximity": 19,
              "stolen": 100, 
              "non_stolen": 111
            }
            ```
            `proximity` is the count of matching stolen bikes within the proximity of your search. If no location was included, the location is determined via IP geolocation.
            If you include a serial query, we return `close_serials`
            
            *the `stolen` paramater is ignored, but shown here for consistency*

            Note: [Homoglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph) matching happens for all endpoints (e.g. 1GGGGO will find IGGG0), you don't need to use `close_serials` to get it.

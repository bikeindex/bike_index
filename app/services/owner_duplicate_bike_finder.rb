# Used when registering new bikes, to prevent registering duplicate bikes
module OwnerDuplicateBikeFinder
  # Finds bikes with the given serial number `serial` associated with email
  # address `owner_email`.
  #
  # Matches based on the normalized serial number, and `owner_email` should be
  # found via:
  #
  # - the bike's owner_email attribute (whether it's a phone or email)
  # - the email attribute of any of the bike's owner's (user / creator: via bike.ownerships)
  # - any email associated with any owner (via user.user_emails)
  # - the phone attribute of any of the bike's owner's (user / creator: via bike.ownerships)
  # - the phone associated with any owner (via user.user_phones)
  #
  # Return a Bike object, or nil

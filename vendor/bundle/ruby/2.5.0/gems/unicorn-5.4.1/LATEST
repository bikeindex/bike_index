=== unicorn 5.4.0 / 2017-12-23 23:33 UTC

  Rack hijack support improves as the app code can capture and use
  the Rack `env' privately without copying it (to avoid clobbering
  by another client).  Thanks to Sam Saffron for reporting and
  testing this new feature:

  We also now support $DEBUG being set by the Rack app (instead of
  relying on the "-d" CLI switch).  Thanks to James P Robinson Jr
  for reporting this bug:

    (Coincidentally, this fix will be irrelevant for Ruby 2.5
     which requires 'pp' by default)

  There's a few minor test cleanups and documentation updates, too.

  All commits since v5.3.1 (2017-10-03):

      reduce method calls with String#start_with?
      require 'pp' if $DEBUG is set by Rack app
      avoid reusing env on hijack
      tests: cleanup some unused variable warnings
      ISSUES: add a note about Debian BTS interopability

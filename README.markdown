Bike registration that works: online, powerful, free.

Registering a 🚲 only takes a few minutes and gives 🚴‍♀️ a permanent record linked to their identity that proves ownership in the case of a theft.

We're an open source project. Take a gander through our code, report bugs, or download it and run it locally.

### Dependencies

- [Ruby 2.5](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (we use [RVM](https://rvm.io/))

- [Rails 5.2](http://rubyonrails.org/)

- [Node 12.18](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (We use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage our node version)

- PostgreSQL >= 9.6

- Imagemagick ([railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/374-image-manipulation?view=asciicast))

- [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq), which requires [Redis](http://redis.io/). The [RailsCast on Resque](http://railscasts.com/episodes/271-resque?view=asciicast) is a good resource for getting up and running with Redis.

- *If you turn on caching locally:* [Dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli) ([railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/380-memcached-dalli?view=asciicast) - you will need to install and start memcached `/usr/local/bin/memcached`)

- Requires 1gb of ram (or at least more than 512mb)

## Running Bike Index locally

This explanation assumes you're familiar with developing Ruby on Rails applications.

- `bin/setup` sets up the application and seeds:
  - Three test user accounts: admin@example.com, member@example.com, user@example.com (all have password `pleaseplease12`)
  - Gives user@example.com 50 bikes

- `./start` start the server.

  - [start](start) is a bash script. It starts redis in the background and runs foreman with the [dev procfile](Procfile_development). If you need/prefer something else, do that. If your "something else" isn't running at localhost:3001, change the appropriate values in [Procfile_development](Procfile_development) and [.env](.env)

- Go to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

| Toggle in development | command                      | default  |
| ---------             | -------                      | -------  |
| Caching               | `bin/rake dev:cache`         | disabled |
| [letter_opener][]     | `bin/rake dev:letter_opener` | enabled  |

## Running Bike Index with Docker

For running you need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

- `docker-compose up` build and download containers:
  - Install Ruby and Javascript dependencies
  - Starts all servers (you need to setup the application on the first time, see bellow)

- `docker-compose run app bin/setup` sets up the application and seeds:
  - Three test user accounts: admin@example.com, member@example.com, user@example.com (all have password `pleaseplease12`)
  - Gives user@example.com 50 bikes

- Add `docker-compose run app` before any other rails command, f.e.:
  - `docker-compose run app rails console` for Rails console
  - `docker-compose run app bundle exec rspec` for running tests

- Go to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Internationalization

See the [internationalization docs](docs/internationalization.markdown) for details.

## Testing

We use [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) and
[Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) for testing.

- Run the test suite continuously in the background with `bin/guard` (watches for file changes/saves and runs those specs)

- You may have to manually add the `fuzzystrmatch` extension, which we use for
  near serial searches, to your databases. The migration should take care of
  this but sometimes doesn't. Open the databases in postgres
  (`psql bikeindex_development` and `psql bikeindex_test`) and add the extension.

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;
  ```

We use [`parallel_tests`](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests/) to run the test suite in parallel. By default, this will spawn one process per CPU in your computer.

- Run all the tests in parallel with `bin/rake parallel:spec`

- Run `bin/rake parallel:prepare` to synchronize the test db schema after migrations (rather than `db:test:prepare`).

- Run specific files or test directories with `bin/parallel_rspec <FILES_OR_FOLDERS>`

- Run Guard with parallelism `bin/guard -G Guardfile_parallel`

## Code Hygiene

We use the following tools to automate code formatting and linting:

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [StandardRB](https://github.com/testdouble/standard)
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)

### EditorConfig

EditorConfig ensures whitespace consistency. See the [Download a
Plugin][editorconfig-plugin] section of the EditorConfig docs to find a plugin
appropriate to your editor.

[editorconfig-plugin]: https://editorconfig.org/#download

### StandardRB

StandardRB is an opinionated Ruby style guide, linter, and formatter - it is "a spiritual port of [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/)".

See the [how do I run standard in my editor](standardrb-plugin) section of the StandardRB docs to find an appropriate plugin for on-the-fly linting.

[standardrb-plugin]: https://github.com/testdouble/standard#how-do-i-run-standard-in-my-editor

### ESLint

ESlint is configured to run on project JavaScript. To run it, issue `yarn lint`.

## Vagrant development box

In general, we recommend installing and running the app without Vagrant for local development

If, however, you would prefer to have a virtual environment, this repository contains a Vagrantfile which is used to automatically set up and configure a virtual local (Ubuntu Xenial) development environment with all of the required dependencies preinstalled.

### Dependencies/Requirements
- A computer that supports hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x/AMD-V)

- Vagrant

- VirtualBox

- At least 1.5GB of free memory

Run `vagrant up` to start the virtual machine. Upon first run, it will run various provisioning scripts to install all of the required packages, configure PostgreSQL, and run all of the Ruby commands to initalize a local Bike Index dev environment. Port 3001 is forwarded locally for testing. Be warned, it will take around a half hour or longer (depending on your internet connection) on first run to download additional Vagrant dependencies and to provision the dev environment. You may observe some informational warning messages during the initial setup which you can safely ignore. `vagrant halt` to shutdown the VM. Subsequent startups will take considerably less time after the initial run.

### Troubleshooting
If the initial provisioning fails for any reason, try running `vagrant provision` and see if running the provisioner again completes without error. If not, please try to troubleshoot/google issues as much as possible before filing an issue. Many Vagrant related errors/issues have already been solved and are documented between Stackoverflow and Github. If you run in to an issue you're unable to solve, be sure to include all relevant stdout messages and errors.

## Contributing

Open a Pull request!

Don't wait until you have a finished feature before before opening the PR, unfinished pull requests are welcome! The earlier you open the pull request, the earlier it's possible to discuss the direction of the changes.

Once the PR is ready for review, request review from the relevant person.

If your pull request contains Ruby patches or features, you must include relevant Rspec tests.


... and go hard
